<body>
    <p> My name is Drake Vickers and I like to be called Drake.<br><br>

        email: vickerdr@oregonstate.edu<br><br>

        I am a computer science major with a focus in cyber-security, and I'm a junior.<br><br>

        The most interesting thing that ive done as far as web development was in my freshman
        year I created a website in a Virtual Machine of windows 8 that just stated my name and
        year, not too complex, but it was my first and only web dev experience.<br><br>

        I have signed up for the Ed discussion<br><br>

        The most interesting fact about me currently is that ive owned 6 different cars in the
        past two months as i've been buying and selling cars on facebook marketplace, I'm
        currently driving around a 1992 300zx 5 spd.
