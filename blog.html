   The biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the webpage set up. The actual HTML code
    was super easy and simple. I worked through it by having to switch over to github pages
    because my engineering site was giving me issues. I learned how to add an image to a webpage,
    But i already new how to clone an assignment from github. The most helpful resource was the
    ed discussion it was nice being able to see people struggle with the same issue and have their
    questions answered.<br><br>

    For this project I really just started it late, and struggled with finding how to preview the
    css, pycharm requires the premium so I had to download vscode and do it that way. I think the
    the hardest part was definitely the filter container getting everything spaced out properly was
    a struggle, otherwise I think I did pretty good at replicating the mock.
