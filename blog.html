    Drakes code Blog<br><br>

    code entry #1, 13/10/2024<br><br>

   The biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the webpage set up. The actual HTML code
    was super easy and simple. I worked through it by having to switch over to github pages
    because my engineering site was giving me issues. I learned how to add an image to a webpage,
    But i already new how to clone an assignment from github. The most helpful resource was the
    ed discussion it was nice being able to see people struggle with the same issue and have their
    questions answered.
