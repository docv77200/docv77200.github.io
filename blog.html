   The biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the webpage set up. The actual HTML code
    was super easy and simple. I worked through it by having to switch over to github pages
    because my engineering site was giving me issues. I learned how to add an image to a webpage,
    But i already new how to clone an assignment from github. The most helpful resource was the
    ed discussion it was nice being able to see people struggle with the same issue and have their
    questions answered.<br><br>

    For this project I really just started it late, and struggled with finding how to preview the
    css, pycharm requires the premium so I had to download vscode and do it that way. I think the
    the hardest part was definitely the filter container getting everything spaced out properly was
    a struggle, otherwise I think I did pretty good at replicating the mock.<br><br>

    For this project, the hardest thing was looping through all of the posts, i had to rewatch
    the lectures to really understand how to do it. I managed to loop through the posts to compare
    the data from the posts to the filters selected so only the posts displayed, this was also what
    i had to google. All in all a good challenge.<br><br>

    This project has been a struggle, ive been following along with the lecture notes but man.
    Ive gotten the webpage fully templatized but i cant seem to get the filters to work or the
    add post from the partial to work. First time going to office hours for an assignment. I
    had to internet search about what handlebars is and how to clear the terminal lol.
